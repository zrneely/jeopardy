# Jeopardy Online

Serve the content in static/ through a web server of your choice. `python -m http.server`
works for testing and nginx is a good possibility for deployment. (@David, first run `cd Documents\Misc\jeopardy\static`)

Run a WAMP router on localhost. crossbar is one good option; you can start it with `crossbar start`. (@David, first run `cd Documents\Misc\jeopardy\crossbar_test`)

To run the game server, set the following environment variables:

 - JPDY\_ROUTER\_PORT (required): The port that the WAMP router is running on (on localhost). (@David, `set JPDY_ROUTER_PORT=8080`)

 - RUST\_LOG (optional): Set to "trace" to see all messages, or "jeopardy" to see only messages generated by the server itself. (@David `set RUST_LOG=jeopardy`)

 Set variables in Windows with `set NAME=value`.

 (@David, make sure to `cd Documents\Misc\jeopardy` first. `cargo run`)
