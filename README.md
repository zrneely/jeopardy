# Jeopardy Online

Serve the content in static/ through a web server of your choice. `python -m http.server`
works for testing and nginx is a good possibility for deployment.

Run a WAMP router on localhost. crossbar is one good option; you can start it with `crossbar start`.

To run the game server, set the following environment variables:

 - JPDY\_ROUTER\_PORT (required): The port that the WAMP router is running on (on localhost).

 - RUST\_LOG (optional): Set to "trace" to see all messages, or "jeopardy" to see only messages generated by the server itself.
