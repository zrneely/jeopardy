# Jeopardy Online

Serve the content in static/ through a web server of your choice. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
works for testing and nginx is a good possibility for deployment.

To run the game server, set the following environment variables:

 - JEOPARDY\_ROUTER\_PORT (required): The port that the WAMP router is running on (on localhost).

 - RUST\_LOG (optional): Set to "debug" to see all messages, or "onitama" to see only messages
   generated by the server itself.
