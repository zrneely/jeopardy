# Jeopardy Online

Serve the content in static/ through a web server of your choice. `python -m http.server`
works for testing and nginx is a good possibility for deployment.

Run a WAMP router on the same device that the game server is running on. crossbar is one good option; you can start it with `crossbar start`.

You'll also need to create (and serve) a file in static/ named `config.json`. That file should be a JSON dictionary with the following keys:

 - routerUrl: A string containing the URL that clients will attempt to connect to in order to open a connection to the game server. For development, this is likely something like `ws://127.0.0.1:8080/ws` if your Crossbar router is serving on port 8080.

To run the game server, set the following environment variables:

 - JPDY\_ROUTER\_PORT (required): The port that the WAMP router is running on (on localhost).

 - RUST\_LOG (optional): Set to "trace" to see all messages, or "jeopardy" to see only messages generated by the server itself.
